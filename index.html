        <p class="Programming">Programming has been my dream career since highschool. What attracted me to programming is the way it <em>shapes and changes our general way of thinking.</em> As a programmer, my mind is geared towards creating solutions for real life problems. In this way, programming has given me a chance to give back to the community and make a significant impact. Thanks to my fierce passion for programming, I strive to achieve perfection in all the projects I undertake.</p>

        <li><a href="https://acetips.github.io/photography/"><strong>Photography Website</strong></a></li>
        <p class="p2">This was my very first project when I started my programming journey. The project entailed creating a photography website for a company called DreamArt Photography. It includes a short description about the company and its contact details. I also included a list of some of my favorite images.</p>

        <p class="p2">For this project, I was tasked with creating a webpage for a restaurant called StreetFood. My responsibility was to come up with a webpage that exhibits a design similar to the one given to me by the client. It includes images of food offered in the restaurant for users to choose from.</P>

        <p class="p2">This was a group project, in which I contributed as a Junior Developer alongside three other group members. The project is about a company called Head-Space and Sanity Kenya, responsible for catering to the needs of the youth in Kenya facing mental health issues. The website presents users with a chance to speak to competent psychiatrists in an attempt to resolve their mental health issues. In the project, I specifically worked on the About Us page, which entailed the mission, vision, and values of the company, as well as its leaders.</p>
