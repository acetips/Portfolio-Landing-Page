        <p>This was my very first project when I started my programming journey. The project entailed creating a photography website for a company called DreamArt Photography.

        <h2>Head-Space and Sanity Kenya (HSSK)</h2>
        <p>This was a group project, in which I contributed as a Junior Developer alongside three other group members. The project is about a company called Head-Space and Sanity Kenya, responsible for catering to the needs of the youth in Kenya facing mental health issues. The website presents users with a chance to speak to competent psychiatrists in an attempt to resolve their mental health issues. In the project, I specifically worked on the About Us page, which entailed the mission, vision, and values of the company, as well as its leaders.</p>
